Description:

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level interpereted programming language.
JS is dynamic, and  weakly typed. It is one of the core languages
used in the world wide web. Javascript enables interactive web
pages and is used in nearly all web applications. All major browsers
have a dedicated JS engine to execute it.

JS is a functional language. It works with many different paradigms
including object-oriented and prototype based. It has API's for
working with text, arrays, dates, and regular expressions. JS itself
does not have any networking, storage or graphics facilitues but
rely's on the host environment to that it's embedded on to provide
those features.

History:

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape
Communications. The language was inspired my Java, Scheme and self.
In late 1995 Microsoft began work on Internet Explorer to compete
with the other web browsers of the time. This caused netscape to
merge with Sun to help compete against Microsoft. The name JavaScript
was created as a marketing ploy with the huge hype behind the Java
it was an easy way for them to get recognized even though the weren't
technically companion languages.

JavaScript continues to be one of the most hated Programming languages.
Despite other companies, including Microsoft, Adobe, and Google's, many
attempts to supplement Javascript it continues to thrive and has become
the standard PL of the web. This is contributed to the fact that it was
one of the first but also because it is open, standardized ans well suited
for the web.
