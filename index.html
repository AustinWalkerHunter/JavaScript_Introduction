            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level interpereted programming language.
                JS is dynamic, and  weakly typed. It is one of the core languages
                used in the world wide web. Javascript enables interactive web
                pages and is used in nearly all web applications. All major browsers
                have a dedicated JS engine to execute it.

                JS is a functional language. It works with many different paradigms
                including object-oriented and prototype based. It has API's for
                working with text, arrays, dates, and regular expressions. JS itself
                does not have any networking, storage or graphics facilitues but
                rely's on the host environment to that it's embedded on to provide
                those features.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape
                Communications. The language was inspired my Java, Scheme and self.
                In late 1995 Microsoft began work on Internet Explorer to compete
                with the other web browsers of the time. This caused netscape to
                merge with Sun to help compete against Microsoft. The name JavaScript
                was created as a marketing ploy with the huge hype behind the Java
                it was an easy way for them to get recognized even though the weren't
                technically companion languages.

                JavaScript continues to be one of the most hated Programming languages.
                Despite other companies, including Microsoft, Adobe, and Google's, many
                attempts to supplement Javascript it continues to thrive and has become
                the standard PL of the web. This is contributed to the fact that it was
                one of the first but also because it is open, standardized ans well suited
                for the web.
